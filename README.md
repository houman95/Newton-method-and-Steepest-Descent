# Newton-and-Steepest Descent
This is the Newton algorithm as well as Steepest Descent algorithm for numerical optimization. The line-search algorithm to find the step-size is done with the Golden-Section-Search(GSS) method.
Furthermore, the two functions of "Rosenbrock" and "Powel" as well as their gradient and Hessians are provided to be passed to each algorithm.
